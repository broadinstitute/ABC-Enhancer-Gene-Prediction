> :memo: **Note:** This repository is the version of ABC presented in [Gschwind _et al._ (_BioRxiv_ 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.563812) and is a revamp of the original ABC codebase. To access any previous version of ABC, please visit https://github.com/EngreitzLab/ABC-Enhancer-Gene-Prediction-20250314-archive.
> - For the version of ABC presented in Fulco _et al._ (_Nat. Genet._ 2019)[1], use the [NG2019 branch](https://github.com/EngreitzLab/ABC-Enhancer-Gene-Prediction-20250314-archive/tree/NG2019) of the archived repo
> - For the version of ABC presented in Nasser _et al._ (_Nature_ 2021), use the [master branch](https://github.com/EngreitzLab/ABC-Enhancer-Gene-Prediction-20250314-archive/tree/master) of the archived repo

We have documented the codebase and usage in [Read The Docs](https://abc-enhancer-gene-prediction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

# Activity by Contact Model of Enhancer-Gene Specificity

The Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model predicts which enhancers regulate which genes on a cell type specific basis. This repository contains the code needed to run the ABC model as well as small sample data files, example commands, and some general tips and suggestions.

If you use the ABC model in published research, please cite:
